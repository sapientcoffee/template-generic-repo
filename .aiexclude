# .aiexclude used to exclude files, even of it's open, from Gemini Code Asisst indexing (by default it use any open files)
# it follows the same syntax as a .gitignore file, with the following differences:
#  - An empty .aiexclude file blocks all files in its directory and all sub-directories. This result is the same as a file that contains **/*.
#  - An .aiexclude file doesn't support negation, where you prefix patterns with an exclamation point (!).
